    <h2 class="cold">Psychology of being cool</h2>
    <p>The first is “cachet coolness,” or the socially desirable traits of being friendly, agreeable, and competent.
        Directly opposed to these traits are those that fit into the category of “contrarian coolness,” or the tendency
        to be detached, rebellious, and a bit rough around the edges.</p>

    <h3>How Did Cool Become Such a Big Deal?</h3>
    <p>Cool is still cool. Chaucer, the Oxford English Dictionary tells us, used cool to describe someone’s wit,
        Shakespeare to say, “More than cool reason ever comprehends.”
        But starting around the 1930s, cool began appearing in American English as an extremely casual expression to
        mean something like intensely good.</p>

    <h3>Coolness: An Empirical Investigation</h3>
    <p>Some people are routinely described as “cool,” but it is unknown whether this descriptor conveys trait-like
        information beyond mere likability or popularity. This is the first systematic quantitative investigation of
        coolness from a trait perspective. Three studies of North Americans (N = 918) converged to identify personality
        markers for coolness. Study 1 participants described coolness largely by referring to socially desirable
        attributes (e.g., social, popular, tale)</p>
