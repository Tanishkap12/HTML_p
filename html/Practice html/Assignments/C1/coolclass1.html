    <h1>What is the concept of coolness? </h1>
    <p>Coolness, or being cool, is an aesthetic of attitude, behavior, comportment, appearance, and style that is
        generally admired.Because of the varied and changing interpretation of what is considered "cool‚Äù, as well as its
        subjective nature, the word has no single meaning.</p>

    <h2 class="hot">Cool as a behavioral characteristic</h2>
    <p>The sum and substance of coolness is a self-conscious confidence in overall behavior, which entails a set of
        specific behavioral characteristics that is firmly anchored in symbology, a set of discernible bodily movements,
        postures, facial expressions, and voice modulations that are acquired and take on strategic social value within
        certain contexts.In general, coolness is a trait based on the inference that a cultural object (e.g., a person
        or brand) is autonomous; that is, the person or brand is not constrained by the norms, expectations, or beliefs
        of others.</p>
    <h2>The State of being cool</h2>
    <p>"Cool" is also used for describing a general state of calmness and well-being, or similarly, a transcendent,
        internal state of peace and serenity.[6] It can also refer to an absence of conflict, a state of harmony and
        balance, as in "the land is cool," or as in a "cool [spiritual] heart." Such meanings, according to Thompson,
        are African in origin. Cool is related in this sense to both social control and transcendental balance.</p>
